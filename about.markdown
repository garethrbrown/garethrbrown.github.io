Based in Wiltshire in the UK, I work as a software engineer, I'm available for hire through my company [App Software Ltd](https://www.appsoftware.com/).

If you're interested in my professional skills you can [view my CV here](https://e1.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZHsjJZy3DbalsjiIH9ottKlHCvISn141gy). In short, I'm a .NET developer with a focus on internet engineering, core programming languages being C# and JavaScript, with broad experience of related technologies, frameworks and tools.

Personally, in addition to time with my family, I like to spend time mountain biking, running, and improving my long neglected art skills.
