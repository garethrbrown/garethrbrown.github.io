I've noticed that much of my productivity tooling has become focused on regaining attention and prompting memory so I can pick up where I've left off. [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) has become an invaluable tool for allowing the writing of loosely structred notes which allows me to find my way back into the flow of a project or task.

But why do these tools seem so essential recently? The ability to focus on a single task seems to be being erroded on several fronts. As is already being discussed frequently, smart phones, notifications, instant messaging, wearables and application design seem ever more geared towards trapping our attention.
