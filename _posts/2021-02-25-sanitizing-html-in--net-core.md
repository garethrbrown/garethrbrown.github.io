Looking through options for sanitizing HTML, I found my way to the following library:

HtmlSantizer uses a whitelist approach to HTML sanitization. A whitelist approach to HTML sanitization is more secure in that there is less scope for missing dangerous tags and attributes. It also works well in a markdown context where a limited set of known tags will make up the output HTML.

If you want to allow additional tags and attributes to remain in the output HTML, you can configure the `HtmlSanitizer`class as follows:

```csharp
var sanitizer = new HtmlSanitizer();  
sanitizer.AllowedAttributes.Add("class");  
var sanitized = sanitizer.Sanitize(html);
```
